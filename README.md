# 🗺️ Simple Map with Authentication

This project was developed as part of a code challenge for my first internship opportunity.

## 📍 Project Description

The objective of this project was to create a page that displays a map (using the Google Maps API) with a predefined location. Access to the map is protected by a simple authentication login.

## ✅ Rules

1. No database or file storage is required — authentication must be implemented using a simple method (for exemple an `if-else` logic).
2. The project must be available via an HTTP link.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- NuxtJs
- NodeJs
- Google Maps API
